Implement a Bloom lter for 2,000,000 strings with an error rate of 0:05%, using only
2Mbyte of memory. To achieve this, you create eight bit arrays, each of
2,000,000 bits
(that is, 250,000 char). For each of these, you select a random hash function
hi
from a
universal family. To insert a string s, you set the hi(S)-th bit to one in the
i-th bit array,
for i = 0; : : : ;7. To query whether a string q is contained in the set, you
    check whether
    hi(q) is one in the i-th bit array, for all i.
    The structure must support the following operations
    - bf t * create bf() creates a Bloom lter with the above specication.
    - void insert bf(bf t *b, char *s) inserts the string *s into the Bloom
      lter *b.
      - int is element(bf t *b, char *q) returns 1 if the string *q is accepted
        by the
        Bloom lter, and 0 else.
