Implement a structure that maintains a linear order, based on chapter 6.5 of
the book.
The structure must support the following operations
- o t * create order() creates an empty linear ordered set
- void insert before(o t *ord, key t a, key t b) inserts the key a immediately
before key b in the ordered set.
- void insert after(o t *ord, key t a, key t b) inserts the key a immediately
after key b in the ordered set.
- void insert top(o t *ord, key t a) inserts the key a as largest element in
  the
  ordered set
  - void insert bottom(o t *ord, key t a) inserts the key a as smallest element
    in
    the ordered set
    - void delete o(o t *ord, key t a) deletes the key a from the ordered set
    - int is before(o t *ord, key t a, key t b) returns 1 if key a occurs
      before key
      b in the ordered set, 0 else.
      Here key t is a number type that allows comparisons
