A school has had a month-long bake sale and the number of sales has been 
tabulated according to what type of pastry was sold, what teacher was 
supervising while they were selling, and on what day they were sold (multiple 
teachers may supervise in a given day). 

This data is all in one 3D numpy array, where the first axis refers to the 
pastry type, the second axis refers to the teacher, the third axis refers to 
the day, and the value in the array is an integer saying how many were 
sold for those parameters. 

In another (1D) array is the per-unit profit from selling each type of pastry.

Compute 1) the total profits from the entire bake sale, and 2) the total 
profits under each teacherâ€™s supervision. 

Aside from accessing the data, use of numpy features is not required.  If you
choose to use numpy, assume that your code will be evaluated using version
1.6.1.

Stub code has been provided in bakesale.py.
